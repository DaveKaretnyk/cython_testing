* call_compiler: sample runs from various shells on various systems, what does
  calling the compiler call look like.
* env_vars: environment variables set in various shells on various systems.
    * E.g. VSVARSALL.bat adds / modifies just under 40 environment variables
      when run in an cmd shell
* vs_2017_scripts: just a copy of the VS 2017 content from:
    c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\VC\Auxiliary\Build\
* Invoke-CmdScript.ps1: the alternative script from John Robbins / Wintellect
  to set env vars based an a script supplied, e.g. typically VCVARSALL.BAT.
  Proved to offer nothing additional to what was already being used, but
  useful to archive this nonetheless.
